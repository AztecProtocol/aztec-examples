## Using examples

To see all commands from within an example directory use: `make help`

On linux, if you do not have `make`, you will need the package `build-essential`.

Note: Examples assume you have aztec tools installed: `bash -i <(curl -s https://install.aztec.network)`

Some commands require having a local network running (without its PXE): `NO_PXE=true aztec start --sandbox`
The Private eXecution Environment (PXE) within the `aztec-wallet` will be used.


## Contributions

Example in this repo are heavily curated to showcase and explain atomic functionality of Aztec, as well as slightly larger examples for broader concepts.

Developers: Pull requests contining examples with code AND documentation that fit the brief will be considered.
